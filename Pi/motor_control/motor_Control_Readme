Two modules for motor_control

command_interpret:
	This module takes the raw data received from the router and converts it into a 
	byte array, appending the drive and collector motors addresses. It then sends 
	this array to the command_to_motor module.

command_to_motor:
	This module sends the formatted array to the motor controller.
